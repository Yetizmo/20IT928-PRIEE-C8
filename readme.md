## 📕PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
```text
Due to the ignorance of healthy food habits, obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is reflective of the risks to people’s health. 
People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods, which is the most basic method to avoid obesity. 
However, although food packaging comes with nutrition (and calorie) labels, it’s still not very convenient for people to refer to App-based nutrient dashboard systems which can analyze real-time images of a meal and analyze it for nutritional content which can be very handy and improves the dietary habits, and therefore, helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

This project aims at building a web App that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food.  Our method employs Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for accurate food identification and Food API's to give the nutritional value of the identified food.
```

## 📗WORKFLOW:
```text
User interacts with the Mobile App to Load an image.

The image is passed to the server application, which uses Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model Service to analyze the images and Nutrition API to provide nutritional information about the analyzed Image.

Nutritional information of the analyzed image is returned to the app for display. 
```


## 👨‍💻PROJECT STRUCTURE:
This is the base repository which contains the submodules for the project _Inventory Management System for retailers_. The submodules are as follows:

| S.No | Submodule Name | Repository Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Unico_Backend |  |
| 2 | Unico_Frontend |  |

## 🏗️PROJECT SETUP
Open a terminal and run the following command at your desired location:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yetizmo/20IT928-PRIEE-C8.git
```

This will clone the repository along with all the submodules.

> Note: If you have already cloned the repository without the `--recursive` flag, then run the `update_submodules.sh` (for Linux/macOS) or `update_submodules.cmd` (Windows - Command Prompt) or `update_submodules.ps1` (for Windows - Powershell) script from the root of the repository to clone all the submodules. 

> Alternatively you can run the following command from the root of the repository to clone all the submodules.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
